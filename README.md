# D7041E Miniproject

This project was completed by Stepan Cherevichnik. The project works with six UCI regression datasets, the links and descriptions of which can be found in the corresponding notebook files. In each file, I explore the data, preprocess it with centering and normalization, and then fit four models: linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and neural network. Using cross-validation and grid search, I evaluate multiple hyperparameters for each model and determine the best MSE for each. In the end, I choose the model with the best MSE score.
